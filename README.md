# The Rayden Incident

This is a D&D campaign I'm playing with some friends. Github has a good platform for a wiki and discussion forum, so I thought it might work well for this use case.

## Intro

It all began when the sky split open. You looked up and saw a rift in the world---a giant, ragged window to another place. It tore itself through the sky, showing stars you didn't recognize, and then it shot down to the earth, revealing a strange, alien landscape: trees with thin, wispy trunks covered in a thick glistening ooze, fist sized, jelly-fish like creatures floating in the air, glowing in the moonlight, and blue grass that moved and writhed like it was alive. Before you could react, the rift expanded, moving faster than thought; your vision grew dark and pain overwhelmed all other senses. 

Regaining consciousness in your own bed, your head was pounding, your skin burning. Was it a dream? If not, how did you get back home? Waves of pink, then red, then black flaky iridescent skin cross over your body like frozen water ripples. Over the course of the next few weeks your skin sheds and you take on a new form, discovering abilities and powers you never had before. 

You and the others in your village that experienced similar transformations have been exiled from your home, and left to fend for yourself in the wilds.

Up to now, you've thought little about your long-term plans, still reeling from the sudden and unpleasant changes in your life. Duke Isren, lord of these lands, has agents who seem to be hunting you down. You've barely avoided capture twice now, and one of your companions, Samuel Tanner, has already been slain during a prior encounter. They seem intent on hunting you all down, and either capturing you or killing you if necessary. It is not clear how much longer you can evade them. Exhaustion and hunger are starting to take their toll.

You do know that there are others like you, (you've seen them held in jail carts surrounded by the Duke's agents), and you've seen several rifts open in the sky, far in the distance.

## Background

Everyone was recently living in the backwater village of Hovran. The world, as far as you know, has no experience with the supernatural until now.

You lived in Hovran for at least a few years (maybe all your life), and probably know little of the outside world beyond the neighboring villages and the closest city (Rayden).

## Character Generation

Build a character that has at least one seemingly supernatural element (need not technically be magic). This includes being any non-human race, any spellcasting class, or magic-like feat. Define at least one unusual aspect of your appearance (e.g. blue skin, bulging black veins, etc...).

To be granted a bonus feat of your choice: Describe at least one meaningful relationship with another party member (or the deceased Sammuel Tanner) that existed before your transformation (that's consistent with that character's backstory), and how it has evolved since your transformation. If requested, I can provide more details for Sam, or you can make some up yourself (though I reserve the right to revise some details about Sam before/if we play).
